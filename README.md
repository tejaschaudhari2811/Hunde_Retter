## Rabies Detection in Dogs using Object Detection

## Outline:
1.	Collect newspaper articles where dogs bit humans and later humans killed those dogs. ( Jalgaon Lokmat Papers from 7 Jan 21 to 13 Jan 21.
2.	Animal Protection
3.	Check whether the Idea is plausible.
4.	Collect images of dogs without rabies and with rabies.
5.	Deploy in an app.

## Some thoughts:
1.	Dogs are the result of our domestication of wolves.
2.	If we see it as a problem, in a way we are responsible for it.
3.	Cannot put a price tag on life.
4.	Potentially in future, if surveillance cameras are capable and spread everywhere on streets, model can be deployed to that system.
